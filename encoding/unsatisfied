% Option 1: Unsatisfied rule body, but the head is present in the set 

head_present(X,V):- answer_unsat(X), assignment(X,Y), atom_tuple(V,Y).
body_unsat(X,Y,A,B):- head_present(X,A),any_disjunction_rule(A,B), literal_tuple(B,C), assignment(Y,C), not answer_unsat(Y).
body_unsat(X,Y,A,B):- head_present(X,A),any_disjunction_rule(A,B), literal_tuple(B,-C), assignment(Y,C), answer_unsat(Y).

%Option 2: Fact is missing from the set

fact(X):- output(X,Y), literal_tuple(Y,Z), external(Z,false).
missing_fact(X):- fact(X), not answer_unsat(X).

%Option 3: Anti-fact is present ( :- a. )

anti_fact(X):- any_disjunction_rule(A,B), literal_tuple(B,C), not atom_tuple(A,_),
assignment(X,C), not literal_tuple(B,D), C!=D, assignment(_,D).
anti_fact_present(X):- anti_fact(X), answer_unsat(X).

%Option 4: Not enough or too many atoms chosen in a choice rule

%Option 5: Violated constraint

%Option 6: Does not occur in a rule head but is present in the set

not_mentioned(X):- answer_unsat(X), not output(X,_), not fact(X).
